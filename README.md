This code defines a Python script that sets up a chatbot using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo language model to act as a mental health adviser. The chatbot responds to user messages about stress, anxiety, depression symptoms, and other mental health issues by generating appropriate strategies for coping and improvement.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing necessary modules:

textbase: A module that facilitates the interaction with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
Message: A class to represent a chat message.
models: A sub-module to handle the interaction with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
os: A module to access the operating system environment variables.
List: A type hint for lists.
Setting up the OpenAI API key:
The code sets the API key for the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The API key is necessary to make requests to the OpenAI service. It can be either hardcoded directly in the script or retrieved from an environment variable. For demonstration purposes, it is hard-coded in this code.

Defining the system prompt:
The SYSTEM_PROMPT variable contains a template for the initial message the chatbot will receive when a conversation starts. The prompt instructs the chatbot to act as a mental health adviser, providing guidance and advice on managing stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues. It also sets the expectation for the chatbot's response tone to be precise, soothing, and easy to understand.

Defining the chatbot logic using a decorator:
The function on_message is decorated with @textbase.chatbot("talking-bot"). This decorator configures the function to work as a chatbot with the name "talking-bot."

Chatbot logic:
The on_message function receives two parameters:

message_history: A list of Message objects representing the conversation history.
state: A dictionary to store any stateful information across multiple interactions.
Handling the chatbot state:
The function checks if the state is None or if the "counter" key is missing in the state dictionary. If it's the first interaction, it initializes the state dictionary with a "counter" set to 0.

Generating a chatbot response:
The code uses the models.OpenAI.generate() function to generate a response from the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. It provides the following inputs to the function:

system_prompt: The initial prompt that sets the context for the chatbot's responses.
message_history: The last two messages in the conversation as a list of Message objects. This helps in maintaining context for the model's responses.
model: The specific language model to use, which is "gpt-3.5-turbo" in this case.
Returning the bot response and updated state:
The function returns the generated bot_response and the updated state dictionary (if applicable). The response can be either a string or a tuple containing the response and updated state. The Message objects in the message_history are used to maintain the context in the conversation.

Please note that to run this code, you need to have the textbase package installed, and you also need access to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model using a valid API key. Additionally, ensure that the API key is valid and has the necessary permissions to interact with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
